# Sudoku-Solver
A program to generate and solve sudoku puzzles of varying sizes or difficulties


This is a personal project just to show off programming skill. I have worked on it a bit before but this time I am going to work on it until it is fully finished. 
Some goals as of 1/13/2025:

+ Generate Sudoku boards of the regular size (9x9)
+ Solve a regular Sudoku board
+ Make the above code modular so it can solve irregular sizes
+ Generate an irregular board (4x4 or 16x16 perhaps?)
+ Solve the irregular boards (hopefully without changing code)

Flex goals:
+ Different types of Sudoku boards? (Like the examples here: https://sudoku-puzzles.net/sudoku-variations/)
+ Make the Sudoku puzzles "good" like outlined on this paper: [chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sudoku_Creation_and_Grading.pdf](https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sudoku_Creation_and_Grading.pdf)

I will be using https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/main/ipynb/Sudoku.ipynb as a guide for when I get stumped, so thank you very much to Peter Norvig for the help.
