This is the first time I have tried to do a dev journal, so hopefully it is legible.

1/13/2025:
Goals:
+ Create a menu system to specify sizes of Sudoku boards and/or difficulty
+ Start on creating a data structure for Sudoku boards

Completed:
+ Menu system created
+ Data Structure started - but iteration is needed to fully finish it
+ Started on printing out boards

Thoughts:
+ The only potential boards are ones that are perfect squares, otherwise the Squares (subgrids) wouldn't work.
  So some potential sizes to start with are 4x4, 16x16, 25x25, 36x36, etc.
  + Also it doesn't work if it is not a square (ex: 9x8) as the numbers don't match up (there's no reason to have a 9 in a row of 8)
+ I'm not really sure of what else to include in the menu system, though maybe that will change later
+ It'd probably be nice to track how long the algorithm takes to generate and solve sudoku puzzles
  + Especially since I'll eventually run into a problem with how long it takes
+ In the future I need to commit smaller and more often, this one is quite the big commit

Future goals:
+ Finish being able to print out boards
+ Print out a board of all 0's
+ Generate a filled board
+ Remove some cells numbers to create an actual puzzle
