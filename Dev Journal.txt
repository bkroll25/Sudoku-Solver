This is the first time I have tried to do a dev journal, so hopefully it is legible.

1/13/2025 Approx 2:00 AM-3:00 AM and 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM (only in between classes):
Goals:
+ Create a menu system to specify sizes of Sudoku boards and/or difficulty
+ Start on creating a data structure for Sudoku boards

Completed:
+ Menu system created
+ Data Structure started - but iteration is needed to fully finish it
+ Started on printing out boards

Thoughts:
+ The only potential boards are ones that are perfect squares, otherwise the Squares (subgrids) wouldn't work.
  So some potential sizes to start with are 4x4, 16x16, 25x25, 36x36, etc.
  + Also it doesn't work if it is not a square (ex: 9x8) as the numbers don't match up (there's no reason to have a 9 in a row of 8)
+ I'm not really sure of what else to include in the menu system, though maybe that will change later
+ It'd probably be nice to track how long the algorithm takes to generate and solve sudoku puzzles
  + Especially since I'll eventually run into a problem with how long it takes
+ In the future I need to commit smaller and more often, this one is quite the big commit

Future goals:
+ Finish being able to print out boards
+ Print out a board of all 0's
+ Generate a filled board
+ Remove some cells numbers to create an actual puzzle

I am able to work a small bit in between some of my actual job and dinner, 
but I don't expect to get a crap ton done right now.

Goals:
+ Print out a Sudoku Board of all 0's

Completed:
+ Printing is implemented into the Menu

Thoughts:
+ The printing will work as soon as I get the board to construct the Squares and the Squares to construct the cells
  Right now they are just empty Vectors I think. That will be a project for either after dinner or tomorrow.
+ Had less time than I expected so I couldn't really get anything done.
+ With two files it makes running the code a bit more annoying so I might need to look more into object files or 
  other ways or running more than one code. Right now I am just using the terminal and manually running Sudoku_Solver and Sudoku.cpp.
  Maybe making a makefile wouldn't be a bad idea?

Future Goals:
+ Print the board
+ Add a way to run the files easier (makefile, object files, something)

Working some in between class, we'll see how much I can do
Goals:
+ Print out a Sudoku Board of all 0's

Completed:
+ Printed out a Sudoku board of all 0's

Thoughts:
+ Similar to what I thought, it was mostly just making sure the Squares and Cells
  were actually constructed, and then making it look nice
+ Squares should be pretty easy to search though, but I'm still thinking on how to do row and column
  Making it a 2D array might make those easier, but I would have to change all of my code for that

Future Goals:
+ Generate random numbers
+ Make helper functions to check row, column and square
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1/14/2025 3:33 PM - 4:24
Goals:
+ Generate random numbers
+ Make helper functions to check row, column and square

Completed:
+ Generates filled Sudoku Puzzles

Thoughts:
+ Used some AI to help organize my thoughts and code, though I'm going to try to use it as little as possible
+ As far as I can tell these puzzles are working perfectly well
+ I should probably separate in Board a "solution" and a "puzzle" array where solution is the filled one and puzzle is where some are removed

Future Goals:
+ Remove some numbers from the filled puzzles
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/15/2025 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM
Goals:
+ Remove numbers to form a puzzle

Completed:
+ Removing numbers from a regular 9x9 puzzle

Thoughts:
+ 39 is the suggested amount of hints for a 9x9 sudoku puzzle, as it still allows a single solution
+ How would this be for a different size puzzle? I'll need to figure out how to find it 
  mathmatically for later on in this project

Future Goals:
+ Start solving
