This is the first time I have tried to do a dev journal, so hopefully it is legible.

1/13/2025 Approx 2:00 AM-3:00 AM and 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM (only in between classes):
Goals:
+ Create a menu system to specify sizes of Sudoku boards and/or difficulty
+ Start on creating a data structure for Sudoku boards

Completed:
+ Menu system created
+ Data Structure started - but iteration is needed to fully finish it
+ Started on printing out boards

Thoughts:
+ The only potential boards are ones that are perfect squares, otherwise the Squares (subgrids) wouldn't work.
  So some potential sizes to start with are 4x4, 16x16, 25x25, 36x36, etc.
  + Also it doesn't work if it is not a square (ex: 9x8) as the numbers don't match up (there's no reason to have a 9 in a row of 8)
+ I'm not really sure of what else to include in the menu system, though maybe that will change later
+ It'd probably be nice to track how long the algorithm takes to generate and solve sudoku puzzles
  + Especially since I'll eventually run into a problem with how long it takes
+ In the future I need to commit smaller and more often, this one is quite the big commit

Future goals:
+ Finish being able to print out boards
+ Print out a board of all 0's
+ Generate a filled board
+ Remove some cells numbers to create an actual puzzle

I am able to work a small bit in between some of my actual job and dinner, 
but I don't expect to get a crap ton done right now.

Goals:
+ Print out a Sudoku Board of all 0's

Completed:
+ Printing is implemented into the Menu

Thoughts:
+ The printing will work as soon as I get the board to construct the Squares and the Squares to construct the cells
  Right now they are just empty Vectors I think. That will be a project for either after dinner or tomorrow.
+ Had less time than I expected so I couldn't really get anything done.
+ With two files it makes running the code a bit more annoying so I might need to look more into object files or 
  other ways or running more than one code. Right now I am just using the terminal and manually running Sudoku_Solver and Sudoku.cpp.
  Maybe making a makefile wouldn't be a bad idea?

Future Goals:
+ Print the board
+ Add a way to run the files easier (makefile, object files, something)
